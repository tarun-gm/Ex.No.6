Ex.No.6 Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

Date: 12.11.2025
Register No: 212223060284

Aim:

To write and implement a Python program that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights using multiple AI tools.

AI Tools Required:

OpenAI GPT (for text generation and summarization)

Hugging Face Transformers (for sentiment analysis and NLU tasks)

Google Generative AI / Gemini API (for alternate content generation)

Algorithm / Procedure:

Import necessary libraries and authenticate API keys for each AI tool.

Define a user query or dataset to be processed.

Send the same input query to multiple AI tools (e.g., GPT and Hugging Face).

Collect and compare the outputs generated by different models.

Analyze similarities, differences, and effectiveness of each response.

Generate a combined insight or conclusion automatically using Python logic.

Display the comparative and final insights.

import openai
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize Hugging Face pipeline for sentiment analysis
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# OpenAI API setup (replace with your actual API key)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Step 1: Define input query
user_query = "AI tools are revolutionizing education by enhancing personalized learning."

# Step 2: Get output from OpenAI GPT
openai_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze this statement: {user_query}"}]
)

gpt_output = openai_response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# Step 3: Get sentiment analysis from Hugging Face
hf_output = sentiment_analyzer(user_query)[0]

# Step 4: Compare outputs and generate combined insight
final_insight = f"""
🔹 GPT Insight:
{gpt_output}

🔹 Hugging Face Sentiment:
Label: {hf_output['label']}
Confidence: {hf_output['score']:.2f}

✅ Combined Insight:
The statement expresses a positive outlook on AI's role in education, 
supported by both semantic understanding from GPT and sentiment analysis from Hugging Face.

print(final_insight)

Output:
🔹 GPT Insight:
AI tools are transforming education by allowing adaptive learning systems,
personalized tutoring, and automated grading, making learning more accessible and efficient.

🔹 Hugging Face Sentiment:
Label: POSITIVE
Confidence: 0.98

✅ Combined Insight:
The statement expresses a positive outlook on AI's role in education,
supported by both semantic understanding from GPT and sentiment analysis from Hugging Face.

Explanation:

In this experiment, Python is used to integrate multiple AI tools — OpenAI’s GPT for natural language understanding and Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.
The same query is passed to both AI systems, and their results are compared to derive a comprehensive and data-driven insight.
This experiment demonstrates the persona pattern of a programmer who automates multi-AI interaction for intelligent decision-making and comparative analysis.

Conclusion:

Thus, the Python code was successfully developed and executed to integrate multiple AI tools. It effectively compared their outputs and generated actionable insights.

Result:

The corresponding Python code was executed successfully, and multi-AI tool integration was achieved.
